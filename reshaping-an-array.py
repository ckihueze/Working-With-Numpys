# Using arr.reshape() will give a new shape to an array without changing the data.
# Just remember that when you use the reshape method, the array you want to produce needs to have the same number of elements as the original array.
# If you start with an array with 12 elements, youâ€™ll need to make sure that your new array also has a total of 12 elements.

# You are allowed to have one "unknown" dimension.

# Meaning that you do not have to specify an exact number for one of the dimensions in the reshape method.

# Pass -1 as the value, and NumPy will calculate this number for you.
