# You can easily use create a new array from a section of an existing array.

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# You can also stack two existing arrays, both vertically and horizontally. Letâ€™s say you have two arrays, a1 and a2:

a1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
a2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# you can stack them vertically with vstack()
 
print(np.vstack((a1, a2)))

#  you can stack them horizontally with hstack()

print(np.hstack((a1, a2)))
