# You can easily use create a new array from a section of an existing array.

# You can also stack two existing arrays, both vertically and horizontally. Letâ€™s say you have two arrays, a1 and a2:

a1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [4, 9]])
a2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8], [4, 7]])

# you can stack them vertically with vstack()

#  you can stack them horizontally with hstack()

# You can split an array into several smaller arrays using hsplit. 
# You can specify either the number of equally shaped arrays to return or the columns after which the division should occur.
